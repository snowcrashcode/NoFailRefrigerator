## Overview

This hackathon is about respecting the environment and stading united for the climate by driving sustainable innovation through technology.

Information management is crucial for sustainable development, as it involves the <u>effective collection, storage, dissemination, and utilization of data to support decision making processes.</u>

## Project Details

My project NoFailRefrigerator aims to drive sustainable change in the **cold chain** space by <u>ensuring integrity of transportation and storage of temperature-sensitive products, which is crucial in preventing spoilage and ensuring product efficacy.</u>

### Solution
<u>Machine Learning for Predictive Analysis</u><br>
Apply Isolation Forest ML model to analyze historical and real-time data, predicting potential issues before they occur.
- Predictive Maintenance: Use ML model to predict when refrigeration units might fail, allowing operator to schedule maintenance proactively.
- Anomaly Detection: Identify unusual patterns in temperature data that might indicate a problem, such as a door being left open.

### Implementation
(Areas marked with * are developed after the hackathon)

Planned tasklist

1) Data Collection and Integration
   - Gather historical and real-time data from refrigeration units, including temperature logs, maintenance records and operational parameters [x]
   - Integrate data from various sources to ensure comprehensive and accurate input from ML models [x]
2) Machine Learning Model Development
   - Develop predictive maintenance model using supervised learning algorithms to forecast equipment failures based on historical data. [x]
   - Implement anomaly detection models using unsupervised learning techniques to identify unusual patterns in temperature data, indicating potential issues.
3) Real-Time Data Processing
   - Utilize edge computing to process data in real-time, ensuring tmely detection of anomalies and immediate response to potential problems.
   - Implement cloud-based solutions for data storage, processing and model training to ensuring scalability and robustness.
4) Dashboard and Alerts System *
   - Develop a user-friendly dashboard that visualizes real-time data, predictive maintenance schedules and detected anomalies.
   - Implement an alert system to notify relevant stakeholders of potential issues, enabling proactive maintenance and immediate corrective actions.
5) Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing *
   - Establish partnerships with sustainable suppliers and industry stakeholoders to ensure access to high-quality data and best practices.
   - Promote digital literacy and knowledge sharing among supply chain participants to ensure capacity building and support the adoption of sustainable practices.
